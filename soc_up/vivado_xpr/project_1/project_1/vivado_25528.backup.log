WARNING: [Labtools 27-1974] Mismatch between the design programmed into the device xc7a200t_0 and the probes file(s) .
The device design has 3 ILA core(s) and 0 VIO core(s). 0 ILA core(s) and 0 VIO core(s) are matched in the probes file(s).
Resolution: 
1. Reprogram device with the correct programming file and associated probes file(s) OR
2. Goto device properties and associate the correct probes file(s) with the programming file already programmed in the device.
